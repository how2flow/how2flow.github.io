## Info

<span style="{{ site.en }}">It was first developed by Bosch in 1983, and since its official introduction in 1986,<br>
it has been used in most cars currently produced and has been applied in various other fields.</span>

## Protocols

CAN2.0A / CAN2.0B / CANFD

CAN2.0A: The normal format.<br>
CAN2.0B: The extended format of CAN2.0A.<br>
CANFD: Flexible bitrate & max 64 byte data.<br>

This page is based on CAN 2.0A.<br>
Signal interpretation is easy if you only know the frame and the stuff bit.

### Frame

It is can2.0A frame (44 + 8N bit).

```
| SOF(1) | ID(11) | RTR(1) | IDE(1) | RB(1) | DLC(4) | DATA(8N) | CRC(15) | DEL(1) | ACK(2) | EOF(7) |
```
<span style="color:red; font-size:60%">RB: reserved</span>

### Stuff bit

If the same bit comes out five times in a row, the next bit must use one opposite bit.<br>

```
00000'1'01 ... 11111'0'01 ...
```

## Example

An example of can oscilloscope Waveform (between CAN-rx and GND).

- Raw data

```

- Analyze the raw data according to the frame
