## Trace32 Guidelines

TRACE32 is a powerful debugging and trace toolset developed by Lauterbach, widely used in embedded systems development.<br>
It supports debugging, performance analysis, and real-time tracing for various microcontrollers, processors, and architectures, enabling efficient development and troubleshooting.<br>
This document covers AP processor debugging.<br>
This is because a virtual memory system exists in an AP environment and the powerful functions of a debugger can be fully utilized.<br>
