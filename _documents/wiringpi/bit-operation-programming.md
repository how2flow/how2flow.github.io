## Intro

This page will cover registers and bit operations.<br>
Of course, it is a wiringpi sub-document, but the content will never be limited to wiringpi.<br>
With many different codes in different architectures, It sets the criteria because it is coded with a specific data sheet.<br>

target board is ODROID-C4.<br>

code is [github-source](https://github.com/hardkernel/wiringPi).<br>

## Registers

A register is a small memory space that exists in cpu for the operation of the ALU.<br>
You can simply check the registers [here](/documents/os/overview/#computer-system).<br>
